Beam-solver:

Define beam from:

-Boundry conditions:
	-Fixed
	-Free
	-Pinned

-Modulus of elasticity (constant to begin with)

-Second moment of inerita (constant to begin with)

-Maximum distance from COG

-Must be statically determined (for now)

Define loads:

-q(x)
-Concentrated forces P
-Concentrated moments M
-Constant axial load

Solve for reaction forces and moments:

-SigmaX = 0
-SigmaY = 0
-SigmaM = 0

-Use vertical reaction force and integrate load to find Q(x)

-Use reaction moments and integrate Q(x) to find M(x)

Having obtained M(x) -> Solve the Euler-Bernoulli Beam equation M(x) = -EI*w''(x):

w'(x) = I(-M/EI) + w'(0) = T(x)

w(x) = I(T(x)) + w(0)

Create array showing:
	-M(x)
	-Q(x)
	-w(x)
	-T(x)
	-Max stress(x) (von Mises)

Plot beam with colour indicating stress levels
